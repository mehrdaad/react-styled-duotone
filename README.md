## Up & Running
To install dependencies with Yarn, run:
```sh
$ yarn
```

or to install with npm, run:

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Build
_**NOTE:** When you run `build`, Babel will create a `build` directory. This is what your users
will interact with when they use your library. Nothing in `lib` gets shipped with your
published module._

Run once:
```
$ npm run build
```

Run the watch script:
```
$ npm run build:watch
```

_**NOTE:** the build script runs in the `prepublish` script just before you publish to npm._

## Publishing
If you already have an account with npm, you can simply run:
```
$ npm login
$ npm publish
```

If you don't have an account with npm:

_**NOTE:** Your email address is public_
```
$ npm set init.author.name "Your Name"
$ npm set init.author.email "you@example.com"
$ npm set init.author.url "http://yourblog.com"
$ npm adduser
$ npm publish
```
